# PixelSimulator


A dynamic particle-based game/simulation that generates nature-like patterns and behaviors in the browser.

## Description

This project is an interactive web-based simulation that uses particle systems to create natural-looking phenomena. It combines rendering techniques with particle physics to generate engaging visual effects.

## Features

- Particle-based physics simulation
- Real-time rendering
- Interactive elements
- Browser-based implementation

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- JavaScript
- Canvas API

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main entry point and HTML structure
- `game.js` - Core game logic and initialization
- `particle.js` - Particle system implementation
- `renderingParticle.js` - Rendering logic for particles

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NatureGameGenerator.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd NatureGameGenerator
```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to run the simulation.

## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start the simulation. The particles will begin generating and interacting automatically.
